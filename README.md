## Roadmap
A simple web app that will also use the Gooogle Drive API and google firebase firestore

The application will be able to authenticate with the drive API and upload docx files to a specfic directory.
The directory will have a default "comment only" permission which means that the CVs will be stored there and anyone will be able to comment on them.
After this works we should also intergrate meta data of the documents using the Firestore - we will run a script which will "archive" any old CVs so that the folder doesnt end up too clogged.

We could also create sub directories for the types of jobs the CVs are meant for - e.g Fullstack, back, front, data science...
